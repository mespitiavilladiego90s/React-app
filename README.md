# React + Vite

This project has been built with React + Vite. This was an interface for a restaurant called 'Crispy Chips', which was developed to improve their business records by generating a command, which later will be stored and used to create weekly/monthly/yearly reports. The app has been deployed to netlify, so you can give it a try by yourself if you hit the following link => https://relaxed-bublanina-d7906b.netlify.app/
